% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We present shape measurements of dark matter halos at redshift $z=0$
in a suite of 30 zoom-in simulations from the Auriga project. 
We compare the results in full magnetohydrodynamics against dark
matter only physics. 
We find a strong influence of baryons in making dark matter halos
rounder at all radii compared to its dark matter only counterparts.
This change in triaxility is more pronounced towards the inner
regions of the halo.
At distances $\lesssim 30$ kpc, rounder and coherent dark matter
distributions correlate with extended massive stellar disks and low gas
densities.  
We measure the alignment between the halo and the stellar disk and
find almost perfect alignment at $0.25R_{200}\sim56$ kpc.   
The alignment between the two components changes as a function of
radius implying that the halo shape twists; this effect is almost absent in the dark
matter only simulations. 
We quantify the twisting effect wtih the standard deviation of the
angle between the minor axis of the disk and the halo for radii
$\leq R_{200}$ to show that the twisting correlates positively with
extended stellar disks and low gas densities.
In a comparison against observational constraints of dark matter halo
triaxiality for the Milky Way we find that $20\%$ of halos our sample
are consistent with observational results derived from the Pal 5 stream
that favor $b/a\approx 1$ and $c/a>0.77$. Including baryons is a
required element to achieve this level of agreement.
In contrast, all simulations (dark matter only and with baryons) are at
odds with the constrains derived from the Saggitarius stream that
favor $b/a\approx 0.97$ and $c/a\approx0.44$.

\section{Introduction}

Accurate observations and modeling of our Galaxy 
shape our understanding of the Universe as a whole.  
Explaining the Galaxy's matter composition and kinematical state is 
equivalent to figuring out its formation process in a cosmological
context. 
As a first approximation, the Milky Way's (MW) morphology and
separation into global kinematically coherent components, such as its
disk and bulge, can be used to support the  existence of a Dark Matter
(DM) component to explain its dynamics around the solar neighborhood
\citep{2000MNRAS.311..361O,2009PASJ...61..227S,2010JCAP...08..004C,2013ApJ...779..115B,Iocco15}.  

Improvements in the sensitivity of astronomical observations have 
extended this kind of modelling to outter regions of our Galaxy by measuring
the stellar streams resulting from infalling globular clusters or
satellite galaxies that got tidaly disrutpted by the gravitational
potential of the Milky Way
\citep{1998ApJ...495..297J,1999MNRAS.307..495H, 1999MNRAS.307..877T}. 
The interpretation of such fossil records requires the the
determination of the full three-dimensional gravitational potential of
the Milky  Way.

The observational constraints on the gravitational potential shape can then
be confronted against the expectations from different galaxy formation
models in an explicit cosmological context.
For instance, in the current dominant paradigm of Cold Dark Matter
(CDM) dominated Universe galaxies are expected to be hosted by
triaxial DM halos. To what extent the CDM expectations are born out by
observations in our Galaxy? Can the MW's DM halo shape be considered
typical or atypical in a cosmological context?

These two questions have been difficult to address because for a long
time it was difficult to produce realistic galactic disks within the
CDM context.
The success of such enterprise has ben the result of high numerical
resolution and the understanding that baryonic effects such as stellar
feedback and black hole feedback play an important role in forming a
galactic disk resembling the Milky Way.

Along the way the experiments show that the baryonic effects also impact
the dark matter halo shape making the halo rounder than it otherwise
be in a dark matter only simulation
\citep{Dubinski94,Debattista08,Kazantzidis10,Abadi10,Bryan13,Chua19,Artale19}. 
High resolution simulations have also allowed detailed studies of the
alignment between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo
\cite{Bailin05,DeBuhr12,Debattista13,Gomez17}.


Observationally, some studies prefer oblate configurations at small
distances around $\leq 20$ kpc
\citep[see][]{Law_and_Majewski_2010,Bovy_et_el._2016,Loebman_et_al._2012,Olling_and_Merrifield_2000,Banerjee_and_Chanda_2011} 
and more triaxial and prolate configurations on the outter distances
$\geq 20$ kpc 
\citep[see][]{Vera-Ciro_and_Helmi_2013,Law_and_Majewski_2009,Deg_and_Widrow_2013,Banerjee_and_Chanda_2011}.

However, some  studies are inclined towards prolate configurations even at the inner
parts of the halo \citep[see][]{Bowden_et_al._2016}, and
although it previously seemed that a triaxial DM halo on the
outerskirts would be necessary to fully explain the characterization
of the Sagittarius stream \citep{Law_and_Majewski_2009}, recent studies
questioned this claim by reporting inconsistencies with narrow stellar
streams \citet{Pearson_et_al._2015} or finding that
the relaxation of other constraints may make this claim unnecessary
\citet{Ibata_et_al._2013}. 
axisymmetrical to ensure the stability of a hydrodynamical disk
embeded in a static DM halo. 





All these difficulties (enough numerical resolution, explicit
cosmological context, appropriate feedback physics to produce
realistic MW disks) have limited the studies that want to study the
rounding effect of baryons in MW-like galaxies.
In this work we overcome all these limitations by analyzing the
results of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of isolated
halos that resemble the Milky Way.
We also perform a convergence study with simulation performed at
different resolution levels and explicitly compare the role of DM only
vs. DM+hydro on the MW DM halo shape.


\section{Numerical Simulations}


The Auriga project offers cosmological zoom in simulations of MW-sized 
dark matter halos in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. 
This simulations come in two versions: dark matter only and
baryonic physics including magetohydrodynamics (MHD).
A detailed description of the simulations and their
disk properties can be founc in \citep{auriga}, here we summarize its
main features.

The objects in those simulations were selected from a set of 30
isolated halos in the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their
Environments (EAGLE)  project \citep{Eagle}.   
These halos were randomly selected from a sample of the most isolated
halos at $z=0$ whose virial mass $M_{200}$ was between $10^{12}M_\odot$ and
$2\times 10^{12}M_\odot$. 
The cosmological parameters in these simulatins correspond to
$\Omega_m=0.307$, $\Omega_b=0.048$, $\Omega_\Lambda=0.693$ and a
dimensionless Hubble parameter $h=0.6777$ [CITATION PLANCK 2014]


The selected halos were re-simulated at higher resultion by applying a
zoom-in technique with varying physical realism using the moving-mesh AREPO code
that includes gravity, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), 
phenomenological descriptions for star formation, chemical enrichment
from supernovae and its stellar feedback.  The simulation also follows
the formation and evolution of black holes together with the Active
Galactic Nuclei feedback \citep{arepo} [CITATIONPAKMORE].  


The 30 zoom-in halos have a dark matter particle mass of $\sim 3\times
10^5$\Msun while the barynic mass resolution is $\sim 5\times 10^4$\Msun.
The softening lenght for gravitational force computation for stellar
particles and high-resolution dark matter particles 
is fixed to be 500 $h^{-1}$ pc in comoving coordinates up to $z=1$,
and 396 pc in physical coordinates afterwards.
The gravitational softening lenght for gas cells changes with the mean
cell radius but is limited to be larger than the stellar softening
lenght and 1850 pc physical. 
In this work all the results that we report at $z=0$ as a function of radius and
the correlations with disk properties correspond to the 30 halos in
the \texttt{Level4} resolution. 
Finally, all  halos described so far have also been simulated at the same
resolutions without MHD using dark matter particles only, we refer to
these halos as the DMO (Dark Matter Only) sample.

\section{Halo Shape Measurement}


The DM halo shape at a fixed radius is an estimate of either
the isopotential or isodensity surfaces.  
Observational inference models usually estimate the 
isopotential contours which are probed by tracers (gas, stars), while
simulations work with the isodensity contours which can be directly
calculated from particle positions.  
Furthermore, the density contours in thin shells are very sensitive to
the presence of small satelites.  
For this reason we measure the shape by taking
volume-enclosed particles, rather than shell-enclosed.  
This method yields results in good agreement to the isodensity
contours for radii $leq 140$ kpc as explored by
\citep{VeraCiro11}.  


In particular, we measure the shape using the reduced inertia tensor
\citep{Allgood_et_al._2006},  

\begin{equation}
I_{ij} = \sum_k \frac{x_k^{(i)}x_k^{(j)}}{d^2_k},
\label{eq:inertia}
\end{equation}

where the particle positions are measured from the minimum of the
gravitational potential in each halo and each is weighted by the k-th
particle distance 
$d_k^2=x_k^2+y_k^2+z_k^2$.

The diagonalization of this tensor yields the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues that represent an ellipsoidal dark matter halo.
The axis lenghts of this ellipsoid $a\geq b \geq c$ are the square
root of the ${\bf I}$ eigenvalues and the direction of the principal
axis are the corresponding eigenvectors 

We start the calculations taking into account particles within a
sphere of radius $R$ and then recharacterize the triaxial parameters
by taking into account particles within an ellipsoid of semi-axes
$r,r/q,r/s$ and re-scaled distance $d^2=x^2+(y/q)^2+(z/s)^2$, where $q
= b/a$ and $s=c/a$ are the previously calculated axial ratios. 
We repeat this process until the average deviation of semi-axes is
less than $10^{-6}$.  
After convergence we define a unique radius $R$ as the geometrical
mean of the axial lenghts $R=(abc)^{1/3}$.
We use this radial coordinate $R$ to parameterize the spatial changes
in halo shape we report in the following sections.

This is the same method used to estimate the halo shape in the DM-only
Aquarius simulations \citep{VeraCiro11}. 

Following the convergence criterion by \cite{Vera-Crito_et_al.2011} we
restrict the sampling of the ellipsoidal parameters to radii  between
$\sim 2$kpc and $R_{200}$, where  $R_{200}$ correspond to the  radius
enclosing a sphere with 200 times the critical density of the Universe.
On average, over the 30 halos in the \texttt{Level4} sample
$R_{200}=230\pm 15$kpc. 
For \texttt{Level3} halos we go down to distances of $\sim 0.2$ kpc.  

\section{Results}

\subsection{Radial trends at $z=0$}

In the DMO sample we find that halos are rounder with increasing
radius.
The upper panels in Figure \ref{fig:slices} illustrate this effect.
The contours show a projected DM slice while the ellipsoid corresponds
to the full 3D shape determination. 
There we see a highly ellipsoidal halo shape at radii $\sim 3$kpc
that becomes less triaxial at $\sim 50$ kpc.

We summarize this trend in Figure \ref{fig:triaxiality_plane} by
plotting the results of all the 30 halos in the DMO sample.
The left panel shows every halo in the $c/a$-$b/a$ plane at
two different radii $R_{200}/8 (\sim 20$kpc$)$ and $R_{200}$. 
The outer part of the halo is systematically rounder than its inner
region. 
Nevertheless the halo shape can still be considerated to be prolate at
all radii. 
These plots confirm the results already reported in the
literature \citep{VeraCiro11}.

A different picture presents itself in the MHD sample.
There all halos become rounder at all radii than its DMO
counterpart.
The lower panel in Figure \ref{fig:slices} can be directly compared to
its MHD counterpart; there we observe how at large radii the halo
becomes almost spherical. 
The right panel in Figure \ref{fig:triaxiality_plane} shows the
results for the 30 halos in the MHD sample.
This time the bulk of the halos can be considered oblate and close to
spherical. 

In Figure \ref{fig:triaxial_cumulative} we summarize the results at
different radii using the cumulative distributions for the 
triaxility parameter $T$ defined as 
\begin{equation}
T=\frac{a^2-b^2}{a^2-c^2}.
\label{eq:triaxiality}
\end{equation}
The left panel of this Figure shows that in the DMO sample the
triaxility has a median larger than $0.5$ at all radii, furthermore
this median value increases as we move towards the inner part of the
halo.
The right panel shows the exact complementary picture in the MHD
sampe.
There the median triaxility is alwas smaller than $0.5$ and this
triaxility is smaller as we move closer to the galactic disk.


To quantify to what extend the global effect of decreasing
triaxility in MHD simulations compared to the DMO sample 
holds for individual halos. 
We compute $\Delta T\equiv T_{\rm MHD}-T_{\rm DMO}$ the difference between the
triaxility in the MHD and the DMO simulation for each individual halo. 
Figure \label{fig:delta_triaxial_cumulative} shows the cumulative
distribution at the same radii as in
Figure \label{fig:delta_triaxial_cumulative}. 
    

%\subsection{Shape evolution with cosmic time}

%In the previous section we stablished that DMO halos at $z=0$ have
%a steady and monotonous trend towards decreasing triaxility with
%increasing radius.
%\cite{VeraCiro11} found that this  radial trend at $z=0$ 
%correlates with the halo shape as a function of cosmic time, i.e.
%the halo becomes less triaxial as cosmic time progresses. 
%The hypotesis put forward by \cite{VeraCiro11} is that the correlation
%raises as each radial shell retains memory of the accreting conditions
%at the virial radius at the time of collapse.

%Here we use the six \texttt{level3} halos to measure to what extent
%the presence of baryons affect this memory effect.
%In Figures \ref{fig:triaxial_history_A} and
%\ref{fig:triaxial_history_B} we follow the shape evolution measured at
%$R_{200}$ since redshift $z=1$ to the present, these results are
%represened by the coloroured dots.
%We compare this temporal evolution against the radial evolution at
%$z=0$ represented by the dash black lines. 

%The left column of Figure \ref{fig:redshift_triaxial} shows the six
%halos in the triaxility plane. 
%The colour dots show the time evolution while the black line
%corresponds to the radial trend at $z=0$.
%The left/right columns correspond to the DMO/MHD simulations, respectively.


%We start by analyzing to what extent the memory effect is
%already present in the DMO sample. 
%The first feature that jumps out is that \texttt{Au-21} in the DMO
%simulation does not have a simple shape evolution history.
%By visual inspection we find that an extended merging substructure
%intereacted in the main halo showing up in the shape measurements,
%making it more difficult to interpret the memory hypothesis.
%For this reason we exclude this halo from the analysis.

%For the other five halos we find simpler temporal and spatial
%evolution histories. 
%Halo \texttt{Au-6} (Figure
%\ref{fig:triaxial_history_A}) shows a broad
%correlation between the two tracks; close to the cases of halos
%\texttt{Aq-4-C} and \texttt{Aq-4-D} in \cite{VeraCiro11}.
%The four other halos (\texttt{Au-16} in Figure
%\ref{fig:triaxial_history_A}; \texttt{Au-23}, \texttt{Au-24},
%\texttt{Au-27} in Figure \ref{fig:triaxial_history_B}) are four
%cases where the temporal evolution if followed very closely by the
%radial trends.
%We conclude that in the DMO sample 4 out of the 5 high resolution
%halos closely follow the memory hypothesis trends and the remaning
%halo shows a reasonable correlation.

%The situation in the MHD simulations is more diverse.
%As expected by the results in the previous section the broad location
%in the triaxility plane of the temporal and radial evolution in the
%MHD simulation is completeley different from its DMO counterpart. 
%In terms of the correlations expected by the memory hypothesis we see

\subsection{Alignments with the stellar disk}


A common assumption in observational models of the MW DM halo is that
its minor axis is perfectly aligned with the stellar disk minor axis.
Although it is a reasonable assumption to guarantee the stability of
the galactic disk in simplified models of isolated galaxies, this
might not hold in an explicit cosmological context. 
To examine the degree of validity of this assumption we study in this
section the alignment between the eigenvectors of the inertia tensor of
stellar particles within $0.1R_{200}$ ($\sim 23\pm 2$ kpc) and the
eigenvectors of the dark matter halo shape.
All the measurements are done at $z=0$.

In Figure \ref{fig:cumulative_alignment} we summarize our main results
regarding these alignments with the halo shape measured at five
different radii.
The upper row shows the alignment of the halos in the DMO simulations
with the stellar disk in the MHD simulations.
The main objective of this measurement is to calibrate the radial
evolution of the DM halo shape. 
We find that the DM shape remains constant with radius.

The lower row in Figure \ref{fig:cumulative_alignment} shows the
alignments with the halo in the MHD simulations. 
This time the halo shape changes and twists at different radii.
However around the radius of $0.25R_{200}$ there is an alignment
almost perfect between the shapes of the stellar disk and the dark
matter halo. 
Above and below this radius there are halos with a lower degree of
alignment.
Across the three different alignments we measure we verify that the
strongest one is indeed the one between the two minor axis.

Statistically the strongest missalignment is found with the halo shape
at a radius of $R_{200}/16\sim (14\pm1)$ kpc. 
At this radius the mean angle and its standard deviation between the
two minor axis is $18 \pm 21$ degrees, with one extreme case
(\texttt{Au-4}) where the angle is close to $78$ degrees. 
In contrast at $0.25 R_{200}$ the angle between the two axis is
$2\pm 3$ degrees without any extreme outlier.





\section{Discussion}

The first effect that we put in evidence in this paper is the effect
of baryons in producing rounder DM halos.

The strength of the change depends on the numerical resolution, the
method to resolve the hydrodynamics and the models describing star
formation and stellar feedback \citep{Debattista08, Bryan13, Butsky16,
  Chua19, Artale19}.  
The key concept unifying these results is that the baryon distribution
influences and correlates with the dark matter halo shape. 
Here we find that the broad tendency is that massive stellar disks
correlate with spherical dark matter distributions. 

In order to explore this idea in the Auriga simulations we quantify
the correlation between halo shape with baryonic disk properties. 
Looking into the measurements already reported by \cite{auriga} and
\cite{Pakmor17} we find three baryonic quantities that have the
strongest correlation with DM halo triaxiality: the central gas
density in a sphere of radius $1$kpc, the disk to total mass ratio and
the optical radius.

Figure \ref{fig:disk_correlations} shows the correlations of
these quantities with the triaxility at five diferent radii.
We use the Spearmen's rank correlation coefficient to quantify the
correlation strength.
We find that the strongest correlations are found with the halo shape
measured at radii smaller than $0.12R_{200}\sim 28$kpc, which 
is close to the upper limit of the disk optical radius among our
simulation sample. 
The trend is such that halos with large triaxiality correlate with
high gas density and stellar disks with low mass and small size.
In turn, massive and large stellar disks within a low density gas
environment correlate with low halo triaxiliaty. 

Our second results deals with the disk-halo shape alignment as a function of
radius. 
In concordance with previous results in DM only simulations we find
that the shells of halo shape are well aligned at different radii.
However, in the presences of baryons these shells twist as a function
of radius.
At a radius of $0.25R_{200}\approx 56$ kpc the alignment between the
stellar disk and the dark matter halo is almost perfect and degrades
at other radii. 
This twisting effect, the change of disk-halo alignment as
a function of radius, is robust across our sample of 30
halos at all radii.
However, its strenght is not the same for all galaxies and strongly
correlates with halo triaxiality measured at $0.12R_{200}$. 

\cite{Bailin05} studied the disk halo alignmnent as a function of
radius.
\cite{Gomez17} studied this in Auriga.
\cite{Debattista13} reported a similar twisting effect, but only at radii smaller
than the disk radius. 
At radii larger than the disk radius, they find, the dark matter
shells stop twisting. 
\cite{JingSuto02} also reported shell alignment twisting in their dark
matter only simulations as measured in the direction changes of large
and medium shape axis. 
They only had three high resolution MW-like halos (with
$\sim 10^{6}$ inside the virial radius) and could not make a
statistical statement about the impact of this effect.
However, they the twisting as an artifact resulting from high values of the
$c/b$ ratios that make the determination of the medium axis boisy.
Could then high triaxility values explain the twisting as a result of
erratic axis directions? 
If the triaxiality were the main culprit behind the twisting, the
correlation between the two quantities should be constant at every
radii.
In Figure \ref{fig:alignment_correlations} we already showed that this
correlation strongly depends on radius, we conclude that high
triaxiality values cannot be the full explanation.
Furthermore the twisting happens in such a way that it allows an
almost perfect alignment between the stellar disk at $0.1R{200}$ and
the halo shape measured at $0.25R_{200}$ 

We now use the results reported by \cite{LM10} and \cite{Bovy16}
to place our results in an observational context.
\cite{LM10} used observations of the Sagittarius tidal stream to
constrain the shape of the gravitational potential.
Their point of depart is that previous studies that assumed an
axisymetric galactic potential were not able to fit all the available
dynamic constraints for the Sagittarius stream, therefore making
necessary the use of a rigid triaxial potential with coaxial potential
ellipsoids for the dark matter component.  
Their results constrain the triaxility of this potential
component. 
They also translate ther results into a triaxiality of the density
contours (that could be compared against our results)
 to be $(c/a)=0.44$ and $(b/a)=0.97$ at a radius of $\sim 40$kpc. 
They do not report any uncertainties for these two values. 
Looking at their plots for the quality of fit criterion as a function
of dark halo axial scales (their Figure 5), we choose a conservative $10\%$
relative uncertaintyy
One surprising element in their results is that  the major axis of the
halo shape is perpendicular to the stellar disk plane.  

The results by \cite{Bovy16} have the same general approach but use
instead the GD-1 \citep{2006ApJ...641L..37G} and Pal 5 \citep{2009AJ....137.3378O}
streams to constraint the shape of the dark matter component of the
galacic halo potential.
They use general models with many degrees of freedom for the galactic
potential in order to measure to what extent these two streams are sensitive
to the triaxiality of the dark matter halo component.
The DM component is written directly as a triaxial density profile
with coaxial ellipsoids and the corresponding potential is found by
numerical integration.
They find that the width of the Pal 5 stream constraints $b/a\approx
1$ and therefore fix it to be $b/a=1$ exactly.
Using that value they report their most stringent constrain of
$c/a=0.93\pm0.16$ at a radius of $\approx 19$kpc from the galactic
center. 

Our Figure \label{fig:observations} shows an explicit comparison in
the $c/a$-$b/a$ plane of our results in MHD simulations against the
results by LM10 and BBFK16.  
We find six MHD halos with $b/a<0.93$ and $c/a>0.77$ that could be
considered consistent with their shape constraints  by BBFK16, while
only one outlier DMO halo is consistent with those constraints.
In contrast, none of the simulated halos (MHD nor DMO) is consistent
with the LM10 results. 
The change of triaxility with radius in our simulations cannot account
for these two extremely different shape constraints at different
radii. 


The results by LM10 could then place the dark matter halo of our Milky
Way as an extreme outlier in the $\Lambda$ CDM model. 
This extreme prolateness also correlates with the extreme
triaxiality of the 11 classical satellites of the MW ($c/a\approx
0.2$, and $b/a\approx0.9$) with an spatial distribution 
also oriented perpendicular to the MW plane, another highly unusual
feature in the $\Lambda$ CDM model \citep{2018MNRAS.478.5533F}.


\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we measured the shape of thirty isolated Milky Way like 
dark matter haloes simulated in the Auriga project using the zoom-in
technique. 
The Auriga project simulated these halos with two different setups:
dark matter only (DMO) simulation and full magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
including star formation and feedback.
We used the shape measurement algorithm by \cite{Allgood06} on the
dark matter halos of these two kinds of simulations to quantify the
halo shape as a function of radius and the degree of aligment between
the stellar disk and the halo.

We find that MHD halos are rounder than DMO halos every sampled radii. 
MHD halos tend towards more oblate shapes ($T< 1/3$) DMO halos
tend towards more prolate shapes ($T>2/3$).  
The rounding effect is more noticeable as one moves closer to galactic
disk and strongly  correlates with baryonic properties of the disk
$\leq 0.10R_{200}\approx 20$kpc. 
More precisely, the triaxility is smaller for large and massive
stellar disks with low gas densities in its core $\leq 1$ kpc. 

We also found that the alignment betwen the stellar disk and dark
matter halo changes with the radius.
At a radius of $0.25R_{200}$ the alignment is almost perfect and
degrades at smaller and larger distances.
This alignment evolution implies a radial twisting between the ellipsoids
describing the halo shape. 
We quantify this twist with the standard deviation of the angle
between the two minor axis at radii below $\leq 0.5R_{200}$ and find
that it strongly correlates is with the disk size and the core gas
mass density, there is only a weak correlation with the stellar mass
in the disk.

We compared our results against two observational constraints for the
dark matter halo shape of the Milky Way. 
The constraints are at two different radii and come from different
observatinal tracers. 
We find that $20\%$ halos in the MHD simulations are consistent with
the constraints by \cite{Bovy16} at $\approx 19$kpc, while none of the
halos, either in MHD or DMO, has some overlap with the shape
constraints by \cite{LM10} at $\approx 40$kpc. 

From the results presented in this work we advance the idea that the
twisting shells in the density is a feature that deserves to be
explored in the process of constraining shape parameters from tidal
stream data. 
The inclusion of a parameterization describing this degree of
twisting might relax the conflict between the observational
constraints and the numerical results. 

From the purely numerical point of view a better understading of the
disk-halo alignment details will certainly require to study how the
halo and the disk co-evolved as a function of time.
Calibrating the effect of the cosmic web (both dark matter and gaseous)
\citep{2014MNRAS.443.1090F,2017MNRAS.469..594B,2019MNRAS.487.1607G}
could also be required to gain a full picture of this behaviour.
